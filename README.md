# Lethal Mod Installer

This is a simple program, written in Rust, that installs a list of mods for the game Lethal Company.

It is designed to be used with a TOML file that lists the mods to install, and the program will download and install them in the correct place and format.

## Planned features

For now, only the installation function is developed at all. This will be edited in the future to add improvements.

Some planned features are:

 - Uninstallation of mods
 - Custom configuration support (so you don't have to use [mine](https://github.com/BobdaFett/LethalModInstaller-rs/blob/main/modlist.toml))
 - Support for configuration sharing using [paste.rs](https://paste.rs) or similar
 - Better error handling
